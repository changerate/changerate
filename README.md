## Hi there

I'm a computer science major at Cal Poly Pomona.\
Working on [different projects](https://github.com/changerate?tab=repositories) and having fun.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on leading a machine learning team using YOLOv8 for fire detection and mapping at Cal Poly Pomona.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deep learning models. 
- 🏌🏼‍♂️🏌🏼‍♂️ I’m looking to collaborate on full stack projects. 
- 🏄‍♂️ Looking forward to surfing.
